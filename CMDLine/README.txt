I used python 2.7 to write this applcation

To execute the file using python 2.7 execute:

python test_taker.py

Note: I ran out of time, and I was not able to write any Unit tests, although did test it functionally thuroughly. Also the test assumes that you will enter a number, it doesn't check to see if the input is valid or not, if something doesn't look right you just get the question wrong.
