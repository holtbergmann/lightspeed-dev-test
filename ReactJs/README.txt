Tools: I used the in browser babel compiler for faster development, since this is not a production project,
and I wanted to develop quickly. Otherwise I would have bundled everyting using webpack.

Note: I was not able to finish the ReactJs project. I chose to implement the CSV parser project. I managed
to write the UI section and hooked up each button to method handler, but I have been quite busy, and I am 
traveling this weekend so I really don't know when I would be able to finish the project.

I also was only able to test my .css on safari and chrome. There are .css issues with firefox and I didn't have time
to apply .css speific rules with FF (@-moz-documen)

Lastly, I didn't have any time to write any tests
